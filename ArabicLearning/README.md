# ArabicLearning

The intention for this project is to be build a website for learning Arabic - in essence, a website for a hypothetical Institute of Arabic. The aim is to first cover basic availability of courses, browsing course details and categorising them appropriately. Then increase by introducing teacher's and student's view respectively, then manage their interactions and so on. This is not a project to be built in a single day.

## Current Progress
It is now in an exciting phase. Authentication has been added and enabled for both Identity and External Providers (with more options to be added soon).
As previously, you are able to browse courses by popularity or age, view course details, and now sign in (without any designation to a role).


Next stage: Deligate roles, and create policies around content. Focus more on content such as courses, classes and classroom functionalities.
