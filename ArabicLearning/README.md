# ArabicLearning

The intention for this project is to be build a website for learning Arabic - in essence, a website for a hypothetical Institute of Arabic. The aim is to first cover basic availability of courses, browsing course details and categorising them appropriately. Then increase by introducing teacher's and student's view respectively, then manage their interactions and so on. This is not a project to be built in a single day.

## Current Progress
Still in early stages. You can browse courses by popularity or age, view course details.

Next stage: Refactor code esp. styling. Take care of routes and prepare for adding more complicated features such as authentication.
